                (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).Upon termination, all licenses
                and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use ("Updated Terms") from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative

                of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The
                Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising

                online or offline. You agree that Nashbud is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Nashbud reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common

                including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at

            <h5 class="text-left" style="font-family: 'Fredoka One', cursive;"><strong>Rights We Grant You</strong><br></h5>
            <p class="text-left text-muted" style="font-size: 15px;margin-top: 10px;"><br>Nashbud grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sub licensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services’
                benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community Guidelines, allow.<br><br>Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able
                to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.<br><br>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software,

            <h5 class="text-left" style="font-family: 'Fredoka One', cursive;"><strong>Rights You Grant Us</strong><br></h5>
            <p class="text-left text-muted" style="font-size: 15px;margin-top: 10px;"><br>Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad
                that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.<br><br>We call Activity submissions that are set to be viewable by your Nashbud contacts and followers. For all content you submit , you grant Nashbud
                a worldwide, royalty-free, sub licensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing,
                promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.<br><br>Because Public Content (name, username, profile picture and display (feature) photos and videos) is inherently public and chronicles matters of public
                interest, the license you grant us for this content is broader. In addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast,
                syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload,
                post, or send Public Content, you also grant Nashbud, our affiliates, and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice, including in connection with commercial or
                sponsored content. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Nashbud, our affiliates, or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through the Services, either on the
                Nashbud application or on one of our business partner’s platforms.<br><br>For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy.While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review,
                screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post,
                send, or store through the Service.We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.<br><br><br></p>

Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted
                it. Although Nashbud reserves the right to review or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.<br><br>Through
                these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.<br><br></p>

That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions
                at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.<br><br>While we hope you remain a lifelong Nashbud user, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.<br><br>Nashbud
                may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For

                limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the Indian Council of Arbitration’s rules for arbitration
                of consumer-related disputes and you and Nashbud hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims
                only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Nashbud will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or
                representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Nashbud is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Arbitration Act. In the event the Indian Council of
                Arbitration is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Nashbud or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Indian Institute of Arbitration
                and Mediation. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies
